# SoniX53.github.io
This website is my personal website. And the successor to Priztst.github.io. As of now this is going to be my main priority, when ever I feel like coding.
## Updates:
* New Ver. of IodineGBA is Here! No longer will we be using the 2012 Ver.
* New Webpages! All webpages have been updated to no longer use the template "Diemesion" by HTML5UP.
* 5 Pages!
* New Contact page, incorperates the google form into the html rather then a link.
* Pages no longer serving as a template, chaning to focus more on me compared to "us".
* Maybe some color changes in the future?
